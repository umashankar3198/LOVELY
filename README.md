# LØVELY  

A modular Telegram Python bot running on python3 with a sqlalchemy database.

Can be found on telegram as [LOVELYROBOT](https://t.me/LOVELYR_OBOT).

The Support group can be reached out to at [VEDMATCHAT](https://t.me/VEDMATCHAT), where you can ask for help about [LOVELYROBOT](https://t.me/LOVELYR_OBOT), discover/request new features, report bugs, and stay in the loop whenever a new update is available. 

## How to setup/deploy.

### Read these notes carefully before proceeding 
 - Edit any mentions of @VEDMATCHAT to your own support chat
 - Your code must be open source and a link to your fork's repository must be there in the start reply of the bot [See this](https://github.com/AnimeKaizoku/SaitamaRobot/blob/shiken/SaitamaRobot/__main__.py#L25)
 - Lastly, if you are found to run this repo without the code being open sourced or the repository link not mentioned in the bot, we will push a gban for you in our network because of being in violation of the license, you are free to be a dick and not respect the open source code (we do not mind) but we will not be having you around our chats
 - This repo does not come with technical support, so DO NOT come to us asking help about deploy/console errors
